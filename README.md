# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing proper error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where a database query is performed without handling potential errors.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, ensuring the application behaves predictably even if database operations fail.

## Problem

The `/users/:id` route attempts to retrieve a user from a database based on the provided ID.  However, it lacks error handling for the case where the database query fails. If the query throws an error, the application may crash or exhibit unexpected behavior.  Specifically, no response is sent to the client.

## Solution

The solution involves using a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle errors during the database query. If an error occurs, an appropriate error response (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) is sent to the client, ensuring a consistent and predictable user experience.
